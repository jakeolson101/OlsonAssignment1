Graphics systems are raster based. Raster is an array of picture elements or pixels. Pixels are stored in the framebuffer. Resolution is number of pixels in the framebuffer,determines details.

The conversion of geometric entities to pixel colors and locations in the framebuffer is known as rasterization or scan conversion
